# verilog_ws2811
# *** This is a work in progress as I teach myself Verilog ***
# The project goal is to create a Verilog based controller for WS2811 LED strips
# with various built-in effects, such as rainbows, wipes and sparkles
# (similar to the FastLED library in Arduino).
# Note: I am very much a beginner - this code is probably flawed in many ways!
